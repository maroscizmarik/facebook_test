# facebook_test

Simple test focused on logging in to Facebook app, updating status, asserting the result and logging out.

Please change the login credentials in LoginSteps class on line 16 and 17 for successful login.

Please change the expected name asserted in LoginSteps class on line 29 for successful assertion.

If assertion of updated status fails, please keep in mind that page elements are hard to target on Facebook production environment. Please read the comments in ProfilePage class on line 16. 

Main method to run the test is in the TestFacebook class.

Happy testing :)
